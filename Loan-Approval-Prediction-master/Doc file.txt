->		*	Thankx shardul for the introduction,
		
		*	As he told earlier the variable names and its desciption,
		
		*	Catogerial Variables are as follows :-
			
			*	Gender
			*	Married 
			*	Dependents and
			*	Credit history
			*	Property area
			
		*	First of all, importing all the necessary libraries.
		
		*	After that storing the test and train dataset in df and train dataframe respectively for further operations.
		
		*	Datahack provides seperate train and test csv files.
		
		*	Now understanding various features of dataset.
			
			Hence we use describe function.
			
		*	Now we check weather the catogorial data make sence or not.
		
		*	Here we check this with property area
		
			*	So there are 3 categorize :-
				
				1st is semiurban
				2nd is Urban and 
				last is Rural
				
		*	Now understanding the distributions of numerical values.
		
			*	As of our basic knowledge, we can say that loan approval is based on Applicant income and loan amount.
			
			*	First attribute is ApplicantIncome :-
			
				*	Hence 1st we observe the outlier for the ApplicantIncome column by plotting the histogram.
				
				*	This is the box plot for training dataset.
				
				*	The above Box Plot confirms the presence of a lot of outliers/extreme values. 
					This can be attributed to the income disparity in the society.
					
				*	Now to identify the outliers,
					we plot the box plot for ApplicantIncome by Eduction.
					
					And as a result,
					We can see that there is no substantial different between the mean income of graduate and non-graduates. 
					But there are a higher number of graduates with very high incomes, which are appearing to be the outliers
					
				*	And there are no missing values in the ApplicantIncome column.
			
			*	Second attributed is LoanAmount:-
			
				*	Now applying same to the LoanAmount, we can see the mean and outliers.
			
				*	Now we plot the histogram and Box plot to see the distribution of LoanAmount.
				
				*	From the above, we can conclude that 
					LoanAmount have some missing values and extreme values.
					
			*	Now understanding the distribution of categorial data,
			
				*	422 loans are approved in total.
				
				*	Now we see the creadit history and loan status together.
				
					So there were 378 loans were approved having creadit history 1
					and only 7 were approved having creadit history 0.
					
				*	Hence we can conclude from this point is :-
				
					If we have creadit history 1, our loan is nearly 80% accepted.
					
			*	Now to deal with the outliers,
				best solution is combine the total income of family to form TotalIncome.
				
				Because some applicant may have low income but strong CoApplicantIncome,
				Hence we combine ApplicantIncome and CoApplicantIncome together to form TotalIncome.
				
				Now we can see the distribution and conclude that 
				The extreme values are practically possible, 
				i.e. some people might apply for high value loans due to specific needs. 
				
				So instead of treating them as outliers
				letâ€™s try a log transformation to nullify their effect:
				
				After performing the log operation on TotalIncome, we get highly distributed data.
				
			*	Now we can go for data modeling.
			
			*	We are using sklearn for data modeling.
				And sklearn requires all the inputs to be numberic,
				And hence here we convert all the categorial variables into numerical values.
				
				Before that we need to fill all the missing values in the dataset.
				
				After combining, we can see that there are too much missing values.
				
				We do the log transformation for LoanAmount also to nullify the effect of outliers.
				
			*	Now our taget value is categorial in nature i.e., loan is approved or not.
				Hence we use logestic regression model.
				
				Now Training the model using train dataset and testing it on test dataset.
				We get the output in the New csv file which has loan_id and loan_status colun.
				
			*	We can see the accuracy and cross validation score also.
